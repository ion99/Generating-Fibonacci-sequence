# Generating-Fibonacci-sequence

By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

# Example:

The first 21 Fibonacci numbers Fn for n = 0, 1, 2, â€¦, 20 are:

[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765];
